Project Notes (Martin, 29 Nov):

EDA (renamed from Project.ipynb):
- Should add code verifying that the parquet file exists to make sure there are no errors
- For object types, display some sample modalities to show understanding of the dataset.
- print number of modalities for some categorical features, or a barplot/histogram for checking frequency of each modality.
- I think 1 hot encoding can still be used for the Page feature. It's not a ridiculously large number of unique modalities.
- We can also go further potentially into the EDA, maybe plot some statistical graphs that can show which variables corrolates more to the cancellation page than others.

: define churn target column

: Dropping useless columns 
- firstName & lastName (should be independent to churn)
- sessionId (arbitrary)

Roadmap:
1. Feature engineering:
- Apply one hot encoding to low dimensionality cat. features
 
2. Model building, evaluating, tuning:
a. Build baseline model:
  - Logistic regression
  - Decision trees
    - Base decision tree (baseline benchmark)
    - Ensemble methods: XGBoost, RandomForest, Bagging
  - Neural Network
    - Testing around with different architectures of NN

3. Polishing, inference & interpretability
  - Display model weights, see which features have higher impact on final result.
